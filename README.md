# Groovy NullPointerException in Loosely Typed Method Invocation

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to how null values are handled with loosely typed methods. The core problem is not within the method itself, but in how it's called with a null argument, leading to unexpected results or potential NullPointerExceptions in certain situations.

## Bug Description
Groovy's dynamic typing system often hides potential issues. When invoking methods with null arguments, automatic type coercion might mask errors which might show up in strongly-typed languages.

## Solution
The solution clarifies how to call the method and handle the return value appropriately. Adding explicit null checks before calling the method, and/or checking the return value for null greatly increases robustness.  Explicit type declarations, even in dynamically typed Groovy, can help prevent these types of errors.
